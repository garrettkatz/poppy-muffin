The code in this folder was used for experiments in the paper "Neurosymbolic Robotic Manipulation with a Neural Virtual Machine."

Section V experiments: Run `python nvm_am_compare.py` to reproduce these experiments.  For regenerating the result data, set the `run_exp` variable on line 56 to `True`.  To plot the result data, set the `plt_exp` variable on line 76 to `True`.

Section VI experiments: Run `python practice_failure_case.py` to reproduce these experiments.  For regenerating result data, set the `run_exp` variable on line 97 to `True`.  For plotting the result data, set the `showresults` variable on line 98 to `True`.
