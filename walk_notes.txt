these measurements with textbook under foot were used to assess real command<->com relationships and to initialize wobble:

    start (l_hip_y is offset, -3 acts like 0)
    
    {'l_hip_y': -2, 'l_ankle_y':-1., 'r_hip_y': -1., 'r_ankle_y': 1.}
    
    + {'abs_y': 9, 'r_shoulder_y': -9, 'l_shoulder_y': -9}
    puts center of mass right above right ankle spoke in forward-backward direction
    
    +
    {'abs_x': 26, 'r_shoulder_x': -26, 'bust_x':-26, 'l_shoulder_x':26}
    puts CoM in the support polygon of right foot and left toe
    but very unstable; sometimes would tip right, sometimes would tip left
    eventually settled into balance
    
    -> {'r_ankle_y': 0, 'abs_y': 8, 'r_shoulder_y': -8, 'l_shoulder_y': -8}
    seemed worse to also set l_ankle_y = 0
    
    # swinging leg, but keep r_hip and torso unchanged
    -> {'l_hip_y': -6, 'l_ankle_y': +1}
    can't tell a difference between +/-1 for l ankle
    
    final leg destination should be?
    {'l_hip_y': -4, 'l_ankle_y': 1., 'r_hip_y': 1., 'r_ankle_y': -1.}
    at least, this is mirror of start.

trajectory parameter search ideas:

    start from params all 0 (stationary), gradually perturb to larger and larger distance between feet after each step

    hypotheses:
        stability, Pr(success) are roughly continuous: at least some neighbors of stable/success points should also be so
        there is a connected path through parameter space from 0 boundary thigh angle to large boundary thigh angle where every point along path is successful
            try to find the most stable among these paths
    
    researchy approach:
        you want to quickly approximate a uniform distribution within the connected component of success
        currently you are growing a graph outward from 0
        another way is to do rejection sampling uniformly over the ranges, but more likely to fall or get disconnected components
            are disconnected components that bad?
        try some importance sampling approach:
            want to quickly "estimate the integral" which means sampling from it only
            IS theory says your sampling distribution should be as close as possible to the function being integrated
                more likely to sample near origin?
                adaptive likelihoods based on samples so far
        heuristic idea, maybe relatable:
            sample a point uniformly from the ranges
            test every point along the ray from origin to that point until fall
            or a random path instead of a ray, to avoid non-convexity
