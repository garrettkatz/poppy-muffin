still need:
    zip-ties before moving wildly ?
    wire cutters?

printed with polyamide (nylon plastic)?

it comes with tools!! threadlock, allen wrenches
**do** need electrical adapter for US electricity outlets

tools/materials nice to have (didn't need):
    tweezers + thin pliers
    good screwdriver for pre-allen twists (torx?)
    philips head screwdriver

    1.5,2,2.5mm allen wrenches, long thin Phillips screwdriver, mini flat screwdriver for electronics, presser?, tweezers
    thread lock

        after bom still need to deal with:
            printing the circuit board
            threaded shaft + 4 hex nuts
            M5 Nuts, M5x20mm screws?  Can't find?  Maybe have spares?

install pypot and v-rep (pypot includes herborist)

used screws S1 for hand<->forearm (called is M2x5 screw which didn't exist)

right poppy basic arm: 2/4 upper arm
r_arm_z (ID 53)
r_elbow_y (ID 54)

had to usermod -aG dialout lightop and then restart
had to make sure usb green light to get /dev/ttyACM0
then herborist scan gave error that serial port was busy until I un/replugged usb, and did udevadm trigger, and redid herborist
sometimes need to redo udevadm trigger inbetween flashes

should physically label each part right/left with tape after building

don't have to tighten too far - warps the plastic

watch out for caught wires between plastic and motors when screwing!

put plier needle through motor holes first to wipe away plastic

thigh calls for apparently missing 250mm wire.  although custom seems to be closer to 250 than 220.  right thigh video starts with left and switches  (unless 220 was included in one of the motors?)

chest video doesn't specify bolt lengths.  used S1 in the BNS set for M2, and 2.5x6 for the M2.5 nuts.  after flashing ax-12a, difficult to remove wire, best to use throwaway (not custom).  chest shoulder bolting especially problematic for some reason, maybe screwed first couple too tight.  Later bolts didn't screw well and one broke off.  For second chest shoulder, I didn't screw the first two next to each other but instead spaced initial three as far apart as possible, worked much better.  used doublesided tape instead of glue, presses well into the little spikes on the 6-way splitter chip.

trunk calls for apparently missing 4P 200mm wire (4 individual cables).  But then video cuts two of the 4.  it also brings in an additional 60mm 3P towards the end.  free horns can be difficult to line up: lay flat, turn the motor, don't screw first screw too tight until after some others are in.  Might also be better to screw free horns first before gold horns (can use the central bolt to turn the gold one), that's what he does when attaching the chest.  doubleside tape works less well on shrinkwrapped smps

pelvis had trouble threading before I realized plastic hadn't been snuggly pressed against horn

pliers helped get the two little adjacent M2s on the camera support

camera support attach to face incorrectly calls for 2x4mm bolts (should be 2.5x4mm bolts)?  well, only 2 fits through camera support, but M2.5 nuts fit in the head face... solution: plastic pliable enough to create threads by "screwing" into plastic hole with alan wrench

camera calls for 2x5mm screws, bioloid only has 2x6.  just used 2x6 and it seemed to work.  although (independently?) the camera lens became a bit misaligned with the hole.  samething with speakers.


head instructions don't show flashing the neck eeprom. should be ID=37 according to image in "addressing dynamixel" section.
also don't show attaching the neck piece.  docs suggest 2x5 screws but BOM only had 2x6 (they seem to work ok).  ALSO: don't have the 3 dots to align, but *DO* have notches to align with ax12s.  Lucked out on the first one!  Make sure the second lines up.
head would be easier if attach 3p cables to motor *before* screwing in amp
instructions didn't specify audio jack, just fed it around under odroid, hoping reaches last usb port on splitter
3dsound only fits on isolated hub on splitter, which ends up closer to head's right ear.  should feed audio jack through that side.
handle amp connections gently, they can come out
odroid didn't seem to line up with holes, but once I started screwing them and pliabling the plastic a bit they all worked
slightest tweak to head shape could make neck screws much easier (shorten vestigial prongs, or small hole where screwdriver would go through back head edge.  also, make hole for cables bigger!  and make hdmi accessible!
slightest tweak to feet (remove heel, front top) would improve flexibility

should really setup and troubleshoot board first connection *BEFORE* assembling in head
always remember to unplug power jack on back of head before removing board
manual says that hardware power-off (unplug) is bad for the board.  should do software initiated shutdown.  blue light keeps blinking until all peripherals including hdmi are unplugged.

after head, ready for software:
https://docs.poppy-project.org/en/

connecting: needed avahi (already installed), and select "local link only" for IPv4 config in network manager

Then identity populated with IP 169.254.239.64, could ping with 0% packet loss, but couldn't get there through firefox, even with wifi off

disassembled and then powered on with hdmi to monitor and keyboard/mouse plugged in.  it worked.

had to also do link local network setting ON ODROID!!!!!!!!!! now wired connection 1 connects.

after that, ifconfig on odroid has new inet addr which is also 169.254.xxx.xxx.  That one I can ping from lightop, and tcpdump on odroid sees the pings.  So the inet on lightop is ***lightop***'s address on the little local network, and I had been pinging myself on lightop.

now ssh also finally works.  as well as web browser.  but can't get ssh or even hdmi on reboot... hdmi cable seemed to be supplying some power.  seems related to:
https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=3605

poppy's host key fingerprint is:
SHA256:v0bA58B79WBbZEcFM4gaAihrAjzHFetR3U634I38O6Y

next day first boot worked with dvi -> hdmi converter.  takes some time to boot up (after blue flash?), wait longer on ether?

when I first plug in ether, doesn't seem to autosetup wired connection on odroid, although interface showing up on lightop with same ip as yesterday.  seems to at least remember linklocal on odroid.
  graphically restarted wired connection 1 on odroid desktop and then can ssh in again.  then again, did I uncheck auto connect?  rechecking now, and letting any odroid user do it.
  
even X forwarding works at least on chromium test.
 
odroid ip (today?) is: 169.254.217.32

shutdown, waited some seconds, plugged in again, waited a few seconds after flashing, connected ether only, was able to ssh.

without restarting plugged dvi-hdmi back in, but monitor just black.  plug in keyboard, keystrokes don't wake monitor.  at least can software shutdown now through ssh, with sudo poweroff in ssh session.

powered off and unplugged everything, waited a bit.  then put in hdmi-dvi ***first*** before powering on.  it woke up the monitor again.

now tried again with vanilla hdmi plugged in ***first*** on totally powered down system; it worked.

might not be able to use web and ssh python term simultaneously?

getting lots of python errors now like OSError: Could not initalize robot: No suitable port found for ids [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 51, 52, 53, 54]. These ids are missing [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 51, 52, 53, 54, 31], docs suggest that connections are bad, but for all of them?

Actually, those are precisely the ones in the smps2dynamixel that is not supplied power.  Poweredoff, connected other smps2dynamixel (on upper back), can now access all motors with some serial io warnings but not the OSError.

Trying to find camera.  Ergo Jr had an entry in the json, let's try that.

on odroid: editing ~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/lib/python2.7/site-packages/poppy_humanoid/configuration/poppy_humanoid.json

to include text from ergo jr for "sensors" field:
https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr/blob/master/software/poppy_ergo_jr/configuration/poppy_ergo_jr.json

then I get repeated Dxl serial errors and no >>> prompt.  Back to original and it works again.  Can workaround this with an opencvcamera object outside of the poppyhumanoid object as in test.py in odroid ~, but can't seem to show image.  chromium window opens, so it's a problem with python/matplotlib.  the default backend was agg (non-interactive for pngs etc).  changed backend in matplotlibrc (under site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data).  Agg means raster graphics, and Tk etc is toolkit which should match environment (gnome is around GTK, and KDE around Qt)

Just about every interactive backend needed uninstalled python.  trying to install tkinter, but networking can't reach external internet through lightop.  Trying to add default route.

sudo ip route add default via 169.254.239.64 dev eth0 proto static

updated routing table, but ping 8.8.8.8 still 100% packet loss.  trying to add route for the wired interface to the wireless...

slightest tweak to pelvis/hips would let it sit nicely (supported by mx-64ats)

serious issues with shoulder_y; the angle range is discontinuous and goal_speed behaves unexpectedly

    seems that setting goal speed under the hood just sets a speed magnitude and a goal position at max_pos = 180.  Code could be forked and this could be changed short of a more fundamental fix.  For example, assign each joint its own min/max range based on plastic skeleton contraints.

usb hub doesn't fit into the outside back of head slot (rubber casing too thick) had to buy new one

connecting once everything works:

plug in everything, do
$ ssh poppy@poppy.local
pw: poppy

wrapping up: sudo shutdown -h now

setting up docker:

docker<->poppy networking, trying:
docker network create --driver bridge poppy-net
output: ec0c40bf59ec6d0244f0726760e3ebf61cdb2fbe4cae1ab5bd076804d958172b

poppy has ip something like 169.254.217.32 and has this ip route entry:

same netdevice also has this: 224.0.0.0/4 dev enp0s20f0u2 proto static scope link metric 100

user defined docker bridge has ip 172.18.0.2/16 and this ip route entry:
172.18.0.0/16 dev br-ec0c40bf59ec proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.1

inside docker container, ip route has this:
default via 172.18.0.1 dev eth0 
172.18.0.0/16 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.2

wifi has these ip route entries:
default via 10.1.64.1 dev wlp1s0 proto dhcp metric 600
10.1.64.0/18 dev wlp1s0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.99.2 metric 600

somehow docker is getting to the wifi to ping google.

got lightop's ip (I think?) on wired network from ifconfig, and used it as gateway for new docker network:
docker network create --driver bridge poppy-net2  --subnet 169.254.0.0/16 --gateway 169.254.239.64
16 in subnet specifies first (second?) two bytes of IP.  Now we get:

but now poppy.local is inaccessible outside of docker container!  Removed poppy-net2 and I can ping poppy again.

okay, can ping poppy by ip (not name) when using docker's --network host

$ docker run --init --rm -it --net=host poppymuffin bash

from normal docker, no special network, can ping host's ip on the wired interface, but not poppy's.

ip route add 169.254.217.32 via 169.254.239.64 dev eth0 
ip route add 169.254.0.0/16 via 169.254.239.64 dev eth0 

repeated from earlier:
    serious issues with shoulder_y; the angle range is discontinuous and goal_speed behaves unexpectedly.
    seems that setting goal speed under the hood just sets a speed magnitude and a goal position at max_pos = 180.  Code could be forked and this could be changed short of a more fundamental fix.  For example, assign each joint its own min/max range based on plastic skeleton contraints.


bad joint ranges via record_angles.py and joint_ranges.py:
r_shoulder_y: -270 -> +90
    [-90.2 to 90]~[-270 to -148.8]
r_hip_z: +180 -> -180
    [-24.2 to 180]~[-180 to -144]
l_hip_z: -180 -> +180
    [148.1 to 180]~[-180 to 22.9]
l_shoulder_y: -270 -> +90
    [-92.4 to 90]~[-270 to -150]
    from 75, told it -260, but it tried to go backwards past -92.4, and succeeded, nearly breaking its wires

trying to modify on odroid, /home/poppy/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pypot/dynamixel/motor.py: in DxlMotor base class, changed upper_limit register to rw=True.  Still can't set limits in python

now try to modify json to see what happens:
/home/poppy/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/lib/python2.7/site-packages/poppy_humanoid/configuration/poppy_humanoid.json
original:
    "l_shoulder_y": {
      "offset": 90,
      "type": "MX-28",
      "id": 41,
      "angle_limit": [
        -120,
        155
      ],
      "orientation": "direct"
    }

changing just angle limit: now: [-150..-270]~[90..-90] (same thing).
also changing **offset** to zero: now limits are listed as -180..180.  Actual range: [-60..-180]~[180..0]
offset 0, (0,360): listed limits (0.04-180.), actual: [0..180]~[-180..-60] (same).
offset -180: listed limits (180..360), actual range [180..360]~[0..120]

trying indirect orientation, no idea what it will do. actual range: [180..0]~[360..240]

reverted everything.  This is a huge pain.  As last resort, after demo, could disassemble some joints and reattach at rotated versions to get continuous ranges.  Probably only need that for shoulders, not hips.  For now with crawl, just limit motion to sub-ranges that are contiguous:
l_shoulder_y:  [-90..90]
r_shoulder_y: [-90..90]
l_hip_z: [-180 to 22.9]
r_hip_z: [-24.2 to 180]

motor controllers seem inaccurate when near the discontinuity.  changing crawl angles to be farther (~10deg)


l_shoulder_y: -270 -> +90
    [-92.4 to 90]~[-270 to -150]
    after fix:
    -240 -> 60
r_shoulder_y: -270 -> +90
    [-90.2 to 90]~[-270 to -148.8]
    after fix: -240-62


Loading Poppy Ergo Jr into pybullet:
Unwritten convention that python script using pybullet is next to a "data" folder with urdf, stls, etc
stl files on poppy-ergo-jr git are actually just text files with git-lfs pointers
true stl files available from recent release:
    https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr/releases/tag/1.0.0-gm
stl filenames do not match urdf ("section_1" etc).  cross-referenced urdf links and assembly intructions here:
    https://docs.poppy-project.org/en/assembly-guides/ergo-jr/mechanical-construction.html

    that urdf didn't seem correct in pybullet, trying pip'ing the poppy-ergo-jr package and getting its urdf.  actually it is identical.

------------- poppy ergo jr assembly

needed separate screw and nut (leftover from humanoid) to fasten "standoff" between rasberry pi and pixl chip
very difficult to remove some wires from motors after plugged in
eventually succeeded using one of the red pliers but be very careful about misshaping the plastic
probably best to use same cable connected to raspi for all motors, only remove from motors.  Then keep that cable to eventually attach m1, and chain the others one and only time.
also, seems like it doesn't have to plugged in totally snuggly as long as all pins make contact

should insert nuts in camera holder before mounting to base or camera
need to use metal tool to expand plastic holes a bit, pick out plastic threads, and clamp nuts into plastic hole
needed spare screws (s1) for camera fix

probably easier to attach the other cables before m1, and chip+arm to the wood base, before the first cable to m1 and the camera feed to the chip.

!!!!!! be careful inserting/removing! pins can get bent out of shape

2.5x6 bolts included with ergo are good for fixing chip to wood, but one left over is too long for arm base, use spare 2.5x4 bolts instead
